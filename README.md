# Overview
Create a web app that works on mobile and desktop and shows a 3D scene:
- A glowing ball in the center
- Like a ring of saturn, text around the center. We will need a few different scenes, but one of them shows this text in syllables:
  - OM
  - TA
  - RE
  - TU
  - TA
  - RE
  - TU
  - RE
  - PRA
  - JNA
  - HRING
  - HRING
  - SVA
  - HA
- Each syllable should be spaced out evenly. We will have different numbers of syllables in different scenes.
- Scenes are referred to as "Schemas"
